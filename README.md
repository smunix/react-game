# [react-game][]

A basic OpenGL application that reacts on user inputs at a 60 fps rate.
It makes uses of netwire for its reactive part, updating a network of wires
that output a state object.
By pressing on multiple Keys while the focus is on the app Window, the changing
game state will be dumped on the shell.

Note that this project is using stack (not cabal) with lts-7.14, so updating it should be 
fairly easy in the future.

Before you get started, there are a few things that this template couldn't
provide for you. You should:

Start working on your project with the Stack commands
you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Happy hacking!
